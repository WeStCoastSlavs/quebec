<p><b>Elizabeth II</b> (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born <a href="../../../../articles/2/1/_/21_April_eba5.html" class="mw-redirect" title="21 April">21 April</a> <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>) is the <a href="../../../../articles/q/u/e/Queen.html" title="Queen">Queen</a> of sixteen independent <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">countries</a> and their <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/r/Territory.html" title="Territory">territories</a>.

She became Queen when her father, <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/o/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom_9ca6.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">King George VI</a>, died on 6 February 1952. She has reigned for 56 years (in 2008) and is the oldest reigning monarch in British history. (The <i>longest</i> reigning is <a href="../../../../articles/q/u/e/Queen_Victoria_69b5.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>: 67 years.)</p>

She is the <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Head of the Commonwealth of Nations</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England_4249.html" title="Supreme Governor of the Church of England">Supreme Governor of the Church of England</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/u/House_of_Lancaster_3055.html" class="mw-redirect" title="House of Lancaster">Duke of Lancaster</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Lord of Mann</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/f/i/j/Fiji.html" title="Fiji">Paramount Chief of Fiji</a>.

<p>Queen Elizabeth II probably has a huge amount of power, but she does not use it. She has a very good understanding of politics, but she does not tell the government what to do. In the United Kingdom, she is very interested in the running of the nation, and has regular meetings with her <a href="../../../../articles/g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> ministers.</p>
<p>Since 1947, the Queen has been married to <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/i/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh_e472.html" title="Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>.

The Queen and Prince Philip have four children and eight grandchildren (in 2008).</p>

Her father was the second son of <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/o/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_078f.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a> and brother to the <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/i/Prince_of_Wales_d14a.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a>.

</div>
<p>As a granddaughter of the British sovereign (king), the princess was called "Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth of York". At the time of her birth, she was third in the line of succession to the throne. This meant that if the king died, then the next in line was her uncle the Prince of Wales and then her father, the Duke of York, and then Princess Elizabeth. But when she was born, there was no reason for people to believe that she would become queen. Everyone thought that one day, her uncle would get married and have children. But even though her uncle married, he and his wife never had children.</p>
<p>Her grandfather, King George V, died in 1936. Her uncle became <a href="../../../../articles/e/d/w/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom_3b8e.html" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">King Edward VIII</a>, but only for a short time. He wanted to marry a woman who was divorced. Because (at that time) this was against the law for the king, he <i>abdicated</i> (gave up his throne). His brother, the Duke of York, became <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/o/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom_9ca6.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">King George VI</a>. Elizabeth then became the next in line, the <i>heir presumptive</i> to the throne. <small>(The throne that a ruler sits on, and the crown that they wear are often talked about as symbols for their power.)</small> It was at this time that her grandmother Queen Mary and her mother, who was now called Queen Elizabeth, realised that the Princess's education in history, religion and languages was very important. Queen Mary also gave the Princess lots of good advice on how to behave like a Queen. It was clear that, unless her parents produced a male child, one day Princess Elizabeth would be Queen, not as the wife to a king, but in her own right, like her great-great-grandmother <a href="../../../../articles/q/u/e/Queen_Victoria_69b5.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> who had reigned for 67 years.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth was thirteen years old, the <a href="../../../../articles/w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a> broke out. Because <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> was being bombed, the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were "evacuated" (moved to safety) to <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/n/Windsor_Castle_4be3.html" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/r/Berkshire.html" title="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>. It was suggested that they should be sent to <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> but their mother said: "The children won't go without me. I won't leave the King. And the King will never leave [England]."<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1940, Princess Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the <a href="../../../../articles/b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC's</a> Children's Hour. She spoke to other children who had been evacuated. When she was 13 years old, she first met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece. She fell in love with him and began writing to him when he was in the <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>. <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1945, Princess Elizabeth asked her father to let her work for the war effort. She joined the <i>Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service</i>, as <i>No 230873 Second Subaltern Elizabeth Windsor</i>. She trained as a driver, and drove a military truck.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> She enjoyed training with other young women, and decided to send her own children to school rather than have them educated at home, the way she and her sister were. The Princess Elizabeth was the first, and so far only, female member of the royal family to actually serve in the armed forces, although other royal women have been given honorary ranks.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> During the Victory celebrations in London, she and her sister, <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/i/Princess_Margaret_a62e.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Princess Margaret">Princess Margaret</a>, went out into the crowd after midnight to celebrate with everyone else.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the war, in 1947, Elizabeth made her first official overseas visit. She went with her parent to <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. She and her father, went with Prime Minister Jan Smuts to the top of Table Mountain by cable car. On her 21<sup>st</sup> birthday, she made a broadcast to the British Commonwealth and Empire, pledging:<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

Elizabeth became the first monarch to "circumnavigate" (sail around) the globe. She also became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, New Zealand and Fiji.

<p>When Elizabeth became Queen on 6 February 1952, she was officially Queen of the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and Ceylon (now called <a href="../../../../articles/s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>). These were the Commonwealth Countries. There were many more countries that she also ruled, because they belonged to the British Empire. Altogether, she was sovereign of 32 nations. One by one, many of the countries became independent. They now have their own governments. Some of the countries are republics and have a [[president as "Head of State". Some of them are now independent monarchies that still have the Queen as "Head of State". Queen Elizabeth II is the only monarch of more than one independent nation. The old British Empire became the <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, which includes both monarchies and republics. It is now called "The Commonwealth", and the Queen is the Head of the Commonwealth. She works hard to keep peace and good communication between all the nations that are members.</p>
<p>The Queen is particularly fond of visiting Canada. She has called Canada her "home away from home". She also said "I am pleased to think that there exists in our Commonwealth a country where I can express myself officially in French," and, "whenever you sing [the French words of] '<a href="../../../../articles/o/_/c/O_Canada_ad40.html" title="O Canada">O Canada</a>' you are reminded that you come of a proud race."<sup id="cite_ref-CRHT2_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRHT2-24" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

<p>Ever since she became the Queen, Elizabeth has spent about three hours every day "doing the boxes". The "boxes" are two large red boxes that are brought to her from the Parliament every day. The are full of state papers sent to her from her various departments, embassies, and government offices.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup> One of the most famous photos taken of Elizabeth as a teenager shows her with her father, the King, learning about "the boxes". Because she has been doing this since 1952, she probably knows far more about the government of the UK than anybody else alive.</p>
<p>When the Queen is in London, she meets with her <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> once a week, to discuss things that are affecting the nation. One Prime Minister, <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> wrote: "Anyone who imagines that [these meetings] are a mere formality or confined to social niceties is quite wrong; they are quietly business like and Her Majesty brings to bear a formidable grasp of current issues and breadth of experience."</p>
<p>The Queen also has regular meetings with the First Minister of Scotland and other Ministers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. She also has meetings with <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Prime Minister">Prime Ministers</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/n/Minister.html" title="Minister">Ministers</a> of her other realms, when she is in their country, or when they visit London. She takes a strong interest in the government of her other realms. When Paul Martin, Sr. went to London to discuss the Constitution of Canada, he said later that the Queen knew and understood far more about the Canadian Constitution than any of the British politicians. <sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the late 1990s, there were "referendums" in which the people of Scotland and Wales were asked if they wanted parliaments that were separate from the parliament of the United Kingdom. This was called a "devolution policy". As a result, the new Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly of Wales, were set up. The Queen opened the first sessions of these two bodies.</p>
<p>In Australia, ever since the states became one country at Federation, there has been a movement for Australia to become a <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a>, with an elected President as Head of State instead of the Queen. In 1999, the people of Australia were asked in a referendum whether they wanted a republic. The decision of the people was to remain a monarchy. The Queen visited Australia the following year and said that she would continue to serve Australians as she had done for 48 years.</p>

<p>Elizabeth II, as the Monarch of the United Kingdom, is the "Supreme Governor" of the <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> and sworn protector of the Church of Scotland.

She sometimes attends the yearly meeting of "the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland".</p>
<p>The Queen has a deep religious faith which she sometimes talks about in public. In her Christmas Day television broadcast in 2000, she talked about the <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/l/Millennium.html" title="Millennium">Millennium</a> as marking the 2000<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of <a href="../../../../articles/j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>.

<p>The Queen regularly goes to church at St. George's Chapel at <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/n/Windsor_Castle_4be3.html" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a>. When she stays at Sandringham House, in <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/r/Norfolk.html" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> she goes to St. Mary Magdalene Church.

When the Queen is at Holyroodhouse, which is the Royal Palace in <a href="../../../../articles/e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, she goes to Canongate Kirk.</p>
<p>The Queen often meets with leaders from other religions as well. In 1980 she became the first British Monarch to visit the Vatican, where she was welcomed by <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a>.

<p>The Queen has shown a very strong sense of duty, ever since she was a girl. The "Coronation Oath" that she would serve her people all the days of her life has always been very important to her. Some people think that now that she is old, perhaps she will retire ("abdicate") and let her son Prince Charles take the throne. People who know her well, including Prince Charles, have said that this will never happen.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Queen has often shown her courage, ever since she joined the military at 18, and drove an ambulance in London, while the city was being bombed. During a trip to <a href="../../../../articles/g/h/a/Ghana.html" title="Ghana">Ghana</a> in 1961 she was warned that it was dangerous to be near the President Kwame Nkrumah because people wanted to assassinate him. But she refused to be rude to him by keeping away. The <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harold_Macmillan_7e10.html" title="Harold Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a> wrote that the Queen got very impatient with people if they tried to treat her like "a film star".</p>
<p>In 1964, when the Queen was invited to <a href="../../../../articles/q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>, there were fears for her safety. There were suggestions that the tour should be cancelled. But The Queen’s Private Secretary replied that the Queen would be horrified if she was stopped from going to Quebec because of extremists.<sup id="cite_ref-CRHT1_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CRHT1-33" title="">[34]</a></sup> During the Trooping the Colour in 1981 there was an attempt on the Queen's life. Six rounds of blanks were fired at her from close range as she rode her horse down The Mall. Her only reaction was to duck slightly and then continue on.</p>
<p>In 1982 there was a surprising incident when a man called Michael Fagan successfully broke into Buckingham Palace in the morning, while the Queen's Police Guard was walking the dogs. He set off an alarm but one of the staff turned it off, because they thought it was faulty. Michael Fagan then wandered around, drank a bottle of wine and cut his hand on a broken ashtray. When he found the Queen's bedroom he woke her up, and sat on the end of the bed, to tell her his problems. The Queen kept quite calm. She got up to get him some cigarettes and was able to call a large "footman" (a servant) who held onto the man until the guards came. Michael Fagan was charged with stealing the wine.</p>

<p>Throughout her long reign, Queen Elizabeth II has been supported in her many official duties by her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Philip made an <a href="../../../../articles/o/a/t/Oath.html" title="Oath">Oath of Allegiance</a> to the Queen on the day of her Coronation. The Queen has also had the support of her mother Queen Elizabeth, known as "The Queen Mother", who lived to be 101 years old, and stayed very active in her old-age. The Queen is the patron of many organisations and charities. She has many invitations and official duties. Many of the duties have been shared by other members of the Royal Family, who have also become patrons of many organisations. Among the hard-working Royals are her son Charles, Prince of Wales and her daughter, Anne, the Princess Royal, as well as the Queen's cousins, the Duke of Kent, the Duke of Gloucester, Prince Michael of Kent and Princess Alexandra.</p>

<p>The Queen has had a lot of sadness over the broken marriages and divorces of three of her children, Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew. Prince Charles, to avoid scandal, and because of the position he would one day hold in the Church of England, had difficulty finding a wife who would be acceptable. His marriage to Lady Diana Spencer was thought of as a <a href="../../../../articles/f/a/i/Fairytale.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Fairytale">fairytale</a> wedding because she was young, innocent and beautiful. But it soon became unhappy, and ended in divorce, and in the terrible tragedy of her death in 1997. In the year 2002, within a few months of each other, the Queen's mother and sister Princess Margaret both died.</p>
<p>On April 9, 2005, Prince Charles married Camilla Parker-Bowles, whom he had loved for very many years. Their marriage was a "civil ceremony" in the Guildhall at Windsor, which the Queen did not attend. Some people thought that this was a sign that she did not approve. But the marriage was followed by a religious ceremony in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, which the Queen and all the Royal Family attended.</p>
<p>Of the younger members of the family, it is said that the Queen is very close to her daughter-in-law, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, wife of the Queen's youngest son, Prince Edward. The Queen has a good relationship with all her grandchildren but particularly Prince William, Princess Beatrice and Zara Phillips.</p>
<p>As the Queen has got older, people have sometimes worried about her health. When she appeared with a plaster on her arm, there was a rumour that she was sick, and needed "intravenous" treatment. But in fact, she had been bitten while stopping her dogs from fighting. The Queen is very rarely sick, but lately, has had some problems with her back. Since her 80th birthday, the Queen is leaving more duties to the younger members of the Royal Family, particularly to Prince Charles, who will one day follow her as the reigning monarch.</p>

<li>The Queen gives five big "Garden Parties" in her the Buckingham Palace gardens every year.</li>
<li>The Queen usually lives in old buildings with antique furniture. The only "new" home she ever had was the "Royal Yacht Britannia", so she and Prince Philip loved chosing all the modern furniture.</li>
<li>Before the opening of Parliament, the Queen practices wearing the Imperial State Crown, because it is heavy.</li>
<li>The Queen buys a new State Limousine every ten years. She has a collection of Rolls Royces but her latest car (2002) was a Bentley.</li>
<li>The Queen loves horses. The Queen's favourite horse, Burmese, was given to her by the people of Canada. She rode him at the "Trooping of the Colour" for 27 years.</li>
<li>The Queen owns racehorses. She and the Queen Mother often went to the races together. She has about 25 horses in training each year.</li>
<li>The Queen was worried that a breed of carriage horses called "Cleveland Bays" were becoming <a href="../../../../articles/e/x/t/Extinction.html" title="Extinction">extinct</a>. She bought every one that she could get, and has "rescued" this rare breed.</li>

<p>People often wonder how rich the Queen really is. It is very hard to tell. The reason for this is because she owns several large properties, such as Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle which have never been valued. She also owns a fabulous collection of works of art, which she "holds in trust". This means that she cannot sell them. They belong to "the Crown" but not to Elizabeth as a person. The artworks and the properties are worth billions of dollars.</p>
<p>In 2006, <i>Forbes</i> magazine published an estimate of her personal fortune. They guessed (on evidence) that it was about US$500 million (£280 million).<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
