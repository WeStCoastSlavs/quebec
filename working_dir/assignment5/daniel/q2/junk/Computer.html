<p>Many people think of a computer either as a small gray box with a monitor, which is called a <a href="../../../../articles/p/e/r/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">personal computer</a>, or as a big thing standing around in some special building. Those big computers are usually called <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/i/Mainframe.html" title="Mainframe">mainframes</a>. But there are many types of computer. An <i>embedded computer</i> is a computer that works out information for other things. For example, <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/b/Mobile_phone.html" title="Mobile phone">mobile phones</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/a/u/t/Automatic_Teller_Machine_fcfb.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Automatic Teller Machine">Automatic Teller Machines</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/c/Microwave_oven.html" title="Microwave oven">Microwave ovens</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/c/d/_/CD_Player_e043.html" class="mw-redirect" title="CD Player">CD Players</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">Cars</a> all have small computers inside that help them to work.</p>

<p>Generally, computers are good at the following kind of tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tasks that repeat themselves very often, or are very boring to do for humans.</li>
<li>Storing large amounts of data (in a <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/t/Database.html" title="Database">database</a>). The computer is then able to find similarities. This is called <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/t/Data_mining.html" title="Data mining">data mining</a>.</li>

<p>The knowledge is stored as <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/n/Binary.html" title="Binary">binary</a> <a href="../../../../articles/s/y/m/Symbol.html" title="Symbol">symbols</a> (1s and 0s), and the symbols are put together to make <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">data</a>. A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/t/Bit.html" title="Bit">bit</a>, which comes from the words <b>b</b>inary <a href="../../../../articles/n/u/m/Numerical_digit.html" title="Numerical digit">dig<b>it</b></a>. Computers can use many bits together to represent symbols and <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">math</a> <a href="../../../../articles/e/q/u/Equation.html" title="Equation">equations</a>, and can learn the answers to billions of these equations every second. This lets a computer take very hard tasks or strange ideas, and show them with pictures, sound, and words to communicate with the person using them (the "user"). Most of the time, a computer communicates with the user by drawing pictures or writing words on its <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Computer_monitor.html" title="Computer monitor">monitor</a> (screen), and making sounds through a <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/u/Loudspeaker.html" title="Loudspeaker">loudspeaker</a>.</p>
<p>After the user is done with the data in the computer's <i>memory</i>, called "<a href="../../../../articles/r/a/m/RAM_e536.html" class="mw-redirect" title="RAM">RAM</a>", it will store it on a <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Hard_disk.html" title="Hard disk">hard disk</a>. Most computers have a list of orders that tell the computer how to work with the user. This list of orders is called an <a href="../../../../articles/a/l/g/Algorithm.html" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a>. An <a href="../../../../articles/o/p/e/Operating_system.html" title="Operating system">operating system</a> tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do, how to do these jobs, and how to tell people the results. The disk that contains the operating system is called a <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/o/Boot_device.html" title="Boot device">boot device</a>.</p>
<p>The different jobs that the computer does are called <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Computer_program.html" title="Computer program">computer programs</a>. This lets most computers have the same <a href="../../../../articles/o/p/e/Operating_system.html" title="Operating system">operating system</a>, or list of orders to tell it how to talk to the user, while each computer can have its own computer programs or list of jobs to do what its user needs. Having different programs and <a href="../../../../articles/o/p/e/Operating_system.html" title="Operating system">operating systems</a> makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things. When a user needs to use a computer for something different, the user can learn how to use a new program.</p>

<p>One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Communication.html" title="Communication">communication</a>. Communication is how people share <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a>. Computers have helped people move forward in <a href="../../../../articles/s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/d/Medicine.html" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/b/u/s/Business.html" title="Business">business</a>, and <a href="../../../../articles/l/e/a/Learning.html" title="Learning">learning</a>, because they let experts from anywhere the world work with each other and share information. They also let other <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/people" class="extiw" title="wikt:people">people</a> communicate with each other, do their jobs almost anywhere, learn about almost anything, or share their opinions with each other. The <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> is the thing that lets <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/people" class="extiw" title="wikt:people">people</a> communicate between their computers.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/people" class="extiw" title="wikt:people">people</a> say they like computers and the <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> because everyone can have a <a href="../../../../articles/v/o/i/Voice.html" title="Voice">voice</a> and be heard by whomever wants to listen to what they have to say.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../articles/b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">Blogs</a> are used by many people to say what they want on the <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>. Some people spend most of their time reading and writing blogs. Many <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/people" class="extiw" title="wikt:people">people</a> from all over the world use them. Some people use them to write about things that happen to them. Experts can use them to help people learn more. Some blogs are used by companies to sell things.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Change section: Computers and waste">change</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Computers and waste</span></h2>
<p>A computer is now almost always an electronic device. It usually contains materials that will become <a href="../../../../articles/t/o/x/Toxic_waste.html" title="Toxic waste">toxic waste</a> when disposed of. When a new computer is bought in some places, laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for. This is called <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Product_stewardship.html" title="Product stewardship">product stewardship</a>.</p>
<p>In some countries, old computers are <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/c/Recycle.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Recycle">recycled</a> (melted down) to get <a href="../../../../articles/g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a> and other <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/t/Metal.html" title="Metal">metals</a> from them. This can be dangerous, because this procedure releases the toxic waste into the <a href="../../../../articles/w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/i/Soil.html" title="Soil">soil</a>.</p>
<p>Computers can become <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/obsolete" class="extiw" title="wikt:obsolete">obsolete</a> quickly, depending on what programs the user runs. Very often, they are thrown away within two or three years, because newer programs require a more powerful computer. This makes the problem worse, so <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Computer_recycling.html" title="Computer recycling">computer recycling</a> happens a lot. Many projects try to send working computers to developing nations so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly, as people do not need to run new programs.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Computer_recycling.html" title="Computer recycling">Computer recycling</a> has been seen as a bad idea in the last few years because some still had information on them. This could lead to <a href="../../../../articles/f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a> or identity theft by criminals.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Change section: The main hardware in a computer">change</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The main hardware in a computer</span></h2>
<p>Computers come different forms, but most of them have a common architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>All computers have a <a href="../../../../articles/c/p/u/CPU_2b55.html" class="mw-redirect" title="CPU">CPU</a></li>
<li>All computers have some kind of <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/t/Data_bus.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Data bus">data bus</a> which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment.</li>
<li>All computers have some form of memory. These are usually chips (<a href="../../../../articles/i/n/t/Integrated_circuit.html" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuits</a>) which can hold information.</li>
<li>Many computers have some kind of sensors, which lets them get input from their environment.</li>
<li>Many computers have some kind of display device, which lets them show output. They may also have other peripheral devices connected.</li>
</ul>
<p>A computer has several main parts. When comparing a computer to a human body, the <a href="../../../../articles/c/p/u/CPU_2b55.html" class="mw-redirect" title="CPU">CPU</a> is like a brain. It does most of the 'thinking' and tells the rest of the computer how to work. The CPU is either on or inside the Motherboard, which is like the skeleton. It provides the basis for where the other parts go, and carries the <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/r/Nerves.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Nerves">nerves</a> that connect them to each other and the CPU. The motherboard is connected to a power supply, which provides <a href="../../../../articles/e/l/e/Electricity.html" title="Electricity">electricity</a> to the entire computer. The various drives (<a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Compact_disc.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Compact disc">CD</a> drive, <a href="../../../../articles/f/l/o/Floppy_drive.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Floppy drive">floppy drive</a>, and on many newer computers, USB drive) act like eyes, ears, and fingers, and allow the computer to read different types of storage, in the same way that a human can read different types of books. The <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Hard_drive.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Hard drive">hard drive</a> is like a human's memory, and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer. Most computers have a <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/u/Sound_card.html" title="Sound card">sound card</a> or another method of making sound, which is like vocal cords, or a voice box. Connected to the sound card are <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/u/Loudspeaker.html" title="Loudspeaker">speakers</a>, which are like a mouth, and are where the sound comes out. Computers might also have a <a href="../../../../articles/g/r/a/Graphics_card.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Graphics card">graphics card</a>, which helps the computer to create visual effects, such as 3D environments, or more realistic colors, and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images, in the same way a well trained artist can.</p>
