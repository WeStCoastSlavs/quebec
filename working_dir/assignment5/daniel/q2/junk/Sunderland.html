It sits at the mouth of the River Wear.</p>
<p>Sunderland started as three small villages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monkwearmouth was created in <a href="../../../../articles/6/7/4/674.html" title="674">674</a> when <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/i/Saint.html" title="Saint">Saint</a> Benedict Biscop started a <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/n/Monastery.html" title="Monastery">monastery</a>. Monkwearmouth is on the north side of the river.</li>
<li>Bishopwearmouth was founded in 930. It is on the south side of the river.</li>
<li>Sunderland, at the mouth of the river was a small fishing village. It was given a <i>charter</i> in <a href="../../../../articles/1/1/7/1179.html" title="1179">1179</a>. The charter gave the people of the small town some rights which people outside the town did not have.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sunderland grew as a port, mostly selling <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/l/Salt.html" title="Salt">salt</a>. In the <a href="../../../../articles/1/3/0/1300s.html" title="1300s">1300s</a> people began to build ships along the river bank. By <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a> the port of Sunderland was so important that its name was used when the three old villages became the a borough. Sunderland became a <a href="../../../../articles/c/i/t/City.html" title="City">city</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>.</p>

<p>In 686 the community was taken over by Ceolfrid, and Wearmouth monastery, and its other site in Jarrow, became very important places of learning in Anglo-Saxon England. The library had about 300 books, all of them were hand written and painted.</p>

<p>The Codex Amiatinus, was written and painted at the monastery and was probably worked on by <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/d/Bede.html" title="Bede">Bede</a> who was born at Wearmouth in 673. Bede wrote the <i>Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People)</i> in 731. This is why he is often called&#160;: <i>The father of English history</i>. In the late eighth century the <a href="../../../../articles/v/i/k/Vikings.html" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> began to raid the coast, and by the middle of the ninth century the monastery had been abandoned.</p>
<p>In 930 <a href="../../../../articles/a/t/h/Athelstan.html" title="Athelstan">King Athelstan of England</a> gave the land on the south bank of the river to the Bishop of Durham. This is why the area is still called Bishopwearmouth.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../../articles/1/1/0/1100.html" title="1100">1100</a>, the Bishopwearmouth parish included a small <a href="../../../../articles/f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">fishing</a> village at the mouth of the river (modern day East End) known as 'Soender-land' (which changed into 'Sunderland').<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> This settlement was granted a charter in <a href="../../../../articles/1/1/7/1179.html" title="1179">1179</a> by Hugh Pudsey, then the Bishop of Durham.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../../articles/1/3/4/1346.html" class="mw-redirect" title="1346">1346</a> ships were being built at Wearmouth. The merchant Thomas Menville started building ships so he could transport the things he wanted to sell.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/1/5/8/1589.html" title="1589">1589</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/l/Salt.html" title="Salt">salt</a> making started in Sunderland. Large vats, called ‘’panns’’, of seawater were put on coal fires. When the water boiled the salt was left behind. This is known as salt panning. Today the road leading to where the pans were is still called Pann's Bank. It on the river bank near the city centre. As more coal was needed to heat the salt pans, coal mining started in the area. Only poor quality coal was used in salt panning; the best coal was sold, ipped out of the town. This is why the port began to grow. This put Sunderland in competition for the first time with its coal-trading neighbour <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/w/Newcastle_upon_Tyne_155c.html" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle</a>.</p>

<p>Before the <a href="../../../../articles/e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/1/6/4/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">King Charles I</a> said Newcastle could be the only town in the east of England which could send coal by ship. This had a big impact on Sunderland which was selling more and more coal. This created resentment toward Newcastle and toward the idea of having a king. When the civil war began, the mainly <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Protestant.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> Sunderland sided with Parliament against the mostly <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/t/Catholic.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> Newcastle. This was good for Sunderland's business, because Parliament blockaded (blocked) the Tyne. This stopped the Newcastle coal trade and allowing the Sunderland coal trade to grow. When an army from <a href="../../../../articles/s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> came to fight the King it was based in Sunderland.</p>
<p>The River Wear was not very deep, so the coal had to be loaded onto big boats called <i>keels</i> and taken downriver to the coal ships which were called <i>colliers</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/1/7/1/1719.html" title="1719">1719</a> Sunderland and Bishopwearmouth were too big for the only <a href="http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/parish" class="extiw" title="wikt:parish">parish</a> church, which was in Bishopwearmouth. A new parish of Sunderland was created and Holy Trinity, Sunderland parish church was built. The three original settlements of Wearmouth (Bishopwearmouth, Monkwearmouth and Sunderland) had started to join up. This was because of the success of the port of Sunderland as well as the salt panning and the shipbuilding along the banks of the Wear. Around this time, Sunderland was also known as 'Sunderland-near-the-Sea'.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

When <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/o/Cholera.html" title="Cholera">cholera</a> broke out in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/3/1831.html" title="1831">1831</a> the "select vestrymen", as the church councillors were called, did not know what to about the <a href="../../../../articles/e/p/i/Epidemic.html" title="Epidemic">epidemic</a>. Many were frightened to say that a disease has started because it might stop their businesses from making money. They printed notices which said there was no disease in the town, and saying that the doctors who said that there was disease did not know what they were talking about.</p>
<p>Sunderland was a big trading port at the time. It was the first British town to be affected by 'Indian cholera' epidemic.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> The first victim, William Sproat, died on <a href="../../../../articles/o/c/t/October_23.html" title="October 23">October 23</a> <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/3/1831.html" title="1831">1831</a>. Sunderland was put under quarantine, so that people could not leave the town. The port was blockaded, so that ships could not spread the disease to other ports. But in December of that year cholera was in Gateshead and it spread across the country killing about 32,000 people</p>
<p>Jack Crawford was one of the first to die in the epidemic. There are two statues to Jack, one in Mowbray Park near the Civic Centre, and the other next to Holy Trinity Church.</p>

The Wearmouth Bridge</div>

<p>The river at Sunderland is in a narrow valley, and the town grew up on <a href="../../../../articles/p/l/a/Plateau.html" title="Plateau">plateaus</a> high above the river. This meant it never had the problem of allowing people to cross the river without stopping high masted vessels. Rowland Burdon <a href="../../../../articles/m/p/_/MP_c90a.html" title="MP">MP</a> pushed for the Wearmouth Bridge which was built in <a href="../../../../articles/1/7/9/1796.html" title="1796">1796</a>. It was the second iron bridge ever built. Only the famous Ironbridge itself is older, but Wearmouth bridge was over twice as long and only three-quarters the weight of the Ironbridge. Wearmouth Bridge was the biggest single span bridge in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Further up the river, another bridge, the Queen Alexandra Bridge, was built in 1910, linking the areas of Pallion and Southwick.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>. It was designed for trains to run across too, but the railway section was never completed.</p>

<p>Since <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> industry along the banks of the Wear has changed a lot. Housing, shopping parks and business centres have been built where the shipbuilding yards were. The National Glass Centre is also there, next to the University of Sunderland’s new “St Peter’s Campus”. On the south side of the river the old Vaux Brewery site has been cleared so that new houses, shops and offices can be built close to the city centre.</p>

<p>Much of the city is on a low range of hills running parallel to the coast. On average, it is around 80 metres above sea level. Sunderland is divided by the River Wear which passes through the middle of the city in a deep valley, part of which is known as the Hylton gorge. The only two road bridges connecting the north and south halves of the City are the Queen Alexandra Bridge at Pallion and the Wearmouth Bridge just to the north of the City centre. A third bridge carries the A19 trunk road over the Wear to the West of the City.</p>
<p>Most of the suburbs of Sunderland are west of the city centre with 70% of its population living on the south side of the river and 30% on the north side. The city extends to the seafront at Hendon and Ryhope (on the south) and Seaburn (on the north).</p>

<p>Sunderland has cool winters and warm summers. Being on the coast Sunderland is a little warmer in the winter than the national average, but a little cooler in summer. Average rainfall is below the UK national average due to an East coast location.</p>
<p>As with most UK East-coast towns, Sunderland sometimes gets sea <a href="../../../../articles/f/o/g/Fog.html" title="Fog">fog</a> known locally as <i>Fret</i>. This is most common in the summer months (April - September). These frets can be very dense, are often very localised, and can appear and disappear in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>The Sunderland Empire Theatre, opened in 1907, is the largest theatre in the North East. It reopened in December 2004 following a big redevelopment making the stage bigger. Now it can stage West End shows such as <i>Miss Saigon</i>, <i>Starlight Express</i> and <i><a href="../../../../articles/m/y/_/My_Fair_Lady_56c1.html" title="My Fair Lady">My Fair Lady</a></i>.

<p>The Birmingham Royal Ballet have a season at the Sunderland Empire every year, and it is thought of as the company's north-east home.</p>
<p>The Royalty Theatre is the home to the (amateur) Royalty Theatre group who also put on a number of low-budget productions throughout the year. Renowned film producer David Parfitt belonged to this company before achieving worldwide fame.</p>

<p>Sunderland is one of the most deprived cities in the North of England. 11 of the 25 wards featuring in the list of the 2000 most deprived wards in England.<sup id="cite_ref-eCity_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-eCity-27" title="">[28]</a></sup> The most deprived areas are Southwick to the north of the river and Thorney Close to the south - both with chronic levels of unemployment, although the city is performing better than the North East as a whole.<sup id="cite_ref-eCity_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-eCity-27" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p>Once called the "Greatest Shipbuilding Town in the World"<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup> , ships were built on the Wear from at least 1346 onwards. The Port of Sunderland was expanded in the 1850s when the Hudsons Dock were built for the River Wear Commissioners. Robert Stephenson helped the engineers..<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> Competition from overseas caused a downturn in demand for Sunderland built ships toward the end of the twentieth century. The last shipyard in Sunderland closed in 1988.</p>
<p>Sunderland, part of the Durham coalfield, has a coal-mining heritage that dates back centuries. At the peak in 1923, 170,000 miners were employed in County Durham alone,<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup> as labourers from all over Britain, including many from <a href="../../../../articles/s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, entered the region. As demand for coal fell after World War II, mines began to close across the region, causing mass unemployment. The last coal mine closed in 1994. The site of the last coal mine, Wearmouth Colliery, is now the Stadium of Light, and a miner's Stephenson lamp monument stands outside of the ground to honour the heritage of the site.</p>
<p>Glass has been made in Sunderland for around 1,500 years. But overseas competition has forced the closure of all of Sunderland's glass-making factories. Corning Glass Works was one of the last. It was in Sunderland for 120 years, until <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/March_31.html" title="March 31">March 31</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a><sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vaux Breweries was established in the town centre in the 1880s and for 110 years was a major employer. The brewery was finally closed in July 1999. Vaux in Sunderland and Wards Brewing Company in <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/e/Sheffield.html" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> had been part of the Vaux Group, when both breweries closed the group started to concentrate on its hotels which were in The Swallow Group.

<p>Sunderland's economy began to get better after the 1980s.</p>
<p>The giant Nissan factory moved in, and new service industries arrived. Doxford International Business Park, in the south west of the city, has attracted a host of national and international companies.</p>
<p>The former shipyard areas along the River Wear have also been transformed. Instead of the old industry new developments have been built, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>St. Peter's Campus of the University of Sunderland;</li>
<li>North Haven, executive housing and marina at the old North Dock at Roker;</li>
<li>the National Glass Centre, by St. Peter's Church;</li>
<li>the Stadium of Light the 49,000-capacity home of Sunderland A.F.C.;</li>
<li>Hylton Riverside Retail Park, a large shopping outlet centre at Castletown.</li>
<li>Echo 24 luxury apartments near the city centre.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sunderland Corporation's massive post-war housing estate developments, such as Farringdon, Pennywell, Grindon, Hylton Red House, Hylton Castle, Thorney Close and Town End Farm, together with earlier developments, have all passed into the ownership of Gentoo (once caleed Sunderland Housing Group), a private company and a "Registered Social Landlord". Since the transfer in 2000 there have been a lot of improvements to the quality of social housing in the city.</p>
<p>The central business district of Sunderland has also been redeveloped and improveed. In 2000, The Bridges shopping centre was extended to attract national <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Chain_store.html" title="Chain store">chain stores</a>. In November 2004, after several years with no cinema, a Cineworld multiplex opened in the new River Quarter, an entertainment complex towards the east of the City Centre. The Cinema was taken over by the Empire Multiplex Cinema Company in mid 2006. The previous ABC Cinema, situated on the corner of Park Lane and Holmeside, had been derelict for a number of years until it reopened late in 2005 as The Point, with three bars and the Union nightclub.</p>

Keane has proved a big pull for the city in terms of attracting tourists to Sunderland, with the Tourism Office reporting a dramatic rise in the number of football fans coming to the city "mentioning his name"<sup id="cite_ref-Keane_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Keane-32" title="">[33]</a></sup> as early as October 2006, just six weeks after Keane's appointment as manager. Airline Ryanair, moreover, recorded a 10% increase in passenger numbers travelling to Newcastle Airport on Fridays before a Sunderland home game, some 600 more than on other Fridays. The Tourism Office believes Keane's attachment to the city is causing a knock-on effect on local restaurants, bars and attractions in that more tourists are "making a weekend of it"<sup id="cite_ref-Keane_32-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Keane-32" title="">[33]</a></sup> after watching the football.</p>

<p>There are a number of cycle routes that run through and around Sunderland. The National Cycle Network National Route 1 runs from Ryhope in the south, through the centre of the city, and then along the coast towards South Shields. Britain's most popular long-distance cycle route - The 'C2C' Sea to Sea Cycle Route - traditionally starts (or ends) when the cyclist dips their wheel in the sea on Roker beach. The 'W2W' 'Wear-to-Walney' route, and the 'Two-Rivers' (Tyne and Wear) route also end in Sunderland.</p>
