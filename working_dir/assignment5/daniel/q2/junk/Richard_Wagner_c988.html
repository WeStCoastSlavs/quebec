<b>Richard Wagner</b> (b.<a href="../../../../articles/l/e/i/Leipzig.html" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/y/May_22.html" title="May 22">May 22</a> <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/1/1813.html" title="1813">1813</a>; d.<a href="../../../../articles/v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a> <a href="../../../../articles/f/e/b/February_13.html" title="February 13">February 13</a> <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/8/1883.html" title="1883">1883</a>) was a <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="../../../../articles/o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a> <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Composer.html" title="Composer">composer</a>. He was the most important opera composer in Germany during the <a href="../../../../articles/r/o/m/Romantic_music.html" title="Romantic music">Romantic period</a>. Apart from some music that he wrote as a student he wrote ten operas which are all performed regularly in <a href="../../../../articles/o/p/e/Opera_house.html" title="Opera house">opera houses</a> today. Most of his operas are about stories from German <a href="../../../../articles/m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">mythology</a>. He always wrote the words himself. He changed people’s ideas of what operas should be like. He thought that the <a href="../../../../articles/d/r/a/Drama.html" title="Drama">drama</a> (the story that is being told with all its tensions) was very important, and he chose the singers for his operas himself, so that he could train them into his way of thinking. The music in his operas did not give the audience a chance to applaud after big solos as it had done in the <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>: it continues throughout the whole act. He made his music tell the story by using what he called “<a href="../../../../articles/l/e/i/Leitmotif.html" title="Leitmotif">leitmotifs</a>”. These were <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/l/Melody.html" title="Melody">melodies</a> or short musical phrases which belonged to particular characters in the opera, or to particular ideas. He had more <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/f/Influence.html" title="Influence">influence</a> on other composers than anybody else in his time, largely because of his <a href="../../../../articles/h/a/r/Harmony.html" title="Harmony">harmonies</a> which became more and more <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/r/Chromatic.html" title="Chromatic">chromatic</a> (using lots of <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/t/Note_%28music%29.html" title="Note (music)">sharps and flats</a>, changing <a href="../../../../articles/k/e/y/Key_%28music%29.html" title="Key (music)">key</a> a lot of the time. He built an opera house to his own design in the German town of <a href="../../../../articles/b/a/y/Bayreuth.html" title="Bayreuth">Bayreuth</a>. Nearly all musicians in Europe tried to make a journey to Bayreuth to hear Wagner’s music. The Wagner festival still takes place every year there.</p>

<p>Wagner’s family were all involved in working for the <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/Theatre.html" title="Theatre">theatre</a>. He was not very interested in school work, and taught himself the <a href="../../../../articles/p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Composition.html" title="Composition">composition</a>. He liked reading the <a href="../../../../articles/p/l/a/Play.html" title="Play">plays</a> by <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/g/o/e/Goethe.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Goethe">Goethe</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/s/c/h/Schiller.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Schiller">Schiller</a>.</p>
<p>He studied at the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/University.html" title="University">University</a> of <a href="../../../../articles/l/e/i/Leipzig.html" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, although he was not allowed to be a full student because he did not have proper school qualifications. Although he lived a wild life he worked hard at his music. He studied the <a href="../../../../articles/s/c/o/Score.html" title="Score">scores</a> of <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/e/Beethoven.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Beethoven">Beethoven’s</a> <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/r/String_quartet.html" title="String quartet">string quartets</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/s/y/m/Symphony.html" title="Symphony">symphonies</a> and he wrote his own symphony which was performed in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/3/1833.html" title="1833">1833</a> at the famous Leipzig Gewandhaus. He wrote his first opera, <i>Die Feen</i> (<i>The Fairies</i>) in <a href="../../../../articles/w/%C3%BC/r/W%C3%BCrzburg.html" title="Würzburg">Würzburg</a>. He became the conductor of a travelling opera group and fell in love with one of the singers called Minna Planer and he married her in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/3/1836.html" title="1836">1836</a>. His second opera, <i>Das Liebesverbot</i>, based on Shakespeare’s play <i>Measure for Measure</i> was a failure.</p>
<p>Wagner always liked spending money, and he soon found he owed money to a lot of people, so he went away to <a href="../../../../articles/p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> where he lived for three years. He was not successful at all there, none of the French musicians showed any interest in him and he was very poor. He still managed to write an opera <i>Rienzi</i> in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/4/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a>, and this was soon followed by <i>Der Fliegende Holländer</i>, (<i>The Flying Dutchman</i>), which still remains a favourite to opera lovers today. It was first performed in <a href="../../../../articles/d/r/e/Dresden.html" title="Dresden">Dresden</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/4/1843.html" title="1843">1843</a>. The audience did not like it much because they were used to operas like <i>Rienzi</i> which were written in the old way. Wagner was given the job of court opera composer in Dresden. He stayed there until <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/4/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a>. During that time he worked very hard to make opera performances better, improve the orchestra and train the singers. In <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/4/1845.html" title="1845">1845</a> he wrote another great opera, <i>Tannhäuser</i>. People gradually started to understand the way that Wagner’s music was telling the drama of the story. After this all his operas were great successes, although there always remained some people who hated his music, e.g. the music <a href="../../../../articles/c/r/i/Critic.html" title="Critic">critic</a> <a href="../../../../articles/e/d/u/Eduard_Hanslick_589b.html" title="Eduard Hanslick">Eduard Hanslick</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Richard_Wagner_c988.html" title="Change section: Years in exile">change</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Years in exile</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a> he finished working on <i>Lohengrin</i> but it was not performed because he was supporting the <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolution</a>, joining in the <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/m/Demonstration.html" title="Demonstration">demonstrations</a>. Although he did not take part in the fighting he was going to be <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/r/Arrest.html" title="Arrest">arrested</a>, so <a href="../../../../articles/f/r/a/Franz_Liszt_3c14.html" title="Franz Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> helped him to escape to <a href="../../../../articles/s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. He lived in <a href="../../../../articles/z/%C3%BC/r/Z%C3%BCrich.html" title="Zürich">Zürich</a> until <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/5/1858.html" title="1858">1858</a>. There he wrote about music, conducted, and read stories from the <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/r/Norse.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Norse">Norse</a> mythologies. He was starting to think about writing operas about these stories. It was something that would take him over 25 years to complete. They were to become the four operas known as <i><a href="../../../../articles/d/e/r/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen_e0b8.html" title="Der Ring des Nibelungen">Der Ring des Nibelungen</a></i> (<i>The Ring of the Nibelung</i>) which, together, tell one long story. The four operas which make up this famous Ring cycle are <i><a href="../../../../articles/d/a/s/Das_Rheingold_d1c9.html" title="Das Rheingold">Das Rheingold</a></i> (The Rhinegold), <i><a href="../../../../articles/d/i/e/Die_Walk%C3%BCre_2474.html" title="Die Walküre">Die Walküre</a></i> (<i>The Valkyrie</i>), <i><a href="../../../../articles/s/i/e/Siegfried_%28opera%29.html" title="Siegfried (opera)">Siegfried</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../../articles/g/%C3%B6/t/G%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung.html" title="Götterdämmerung">Götterdämmerung</a></i> (<i>Twilight of the Gods</i>). Because of the political situation in Germany at the time, Wagner expected the rise of a <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/c/Socialist.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Socialist">socialist</a> state. The operas in the Ring cycle were a new kind of music drama (which Wagner simply called “drama”). These operas can be seen as describing a new kind of world in which humans are free. The music used the idea of <a href="../../../../articles/l/e/i/Leitmotif.html" title="Leitmotif">leitmotif</a> (in English: “leading motive”), where musical ideas represent characters or emotions, and help the development and understanding of the story.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/5/1857.html" title="1857">1857</a> Wagner had written the first two operas as well as Acts One and Two of <i>Siegfried</i>. However, the third Act of <i>Siegfried</i> was not written until many years later, because he could see that at that time there was no suitable opera house to have these operas performed. He fell in love with a woman called Mathilde Wesendonk, whose husband was very rich. This affair led to a separation with his wife, Minna. He wrote an opera about an unhappy love affair: <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/r/i/Tristan_und_Isolde_623a.html" title="Tristan und Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a></i> (<i>Tristan and Isolde</i>).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Richard_Wagner_c988.html" title="Change section: Mid career">change</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mid career</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a> the political situation in Germany had changed and he was allowed to return. In <a href="../../../../articles/v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> he heard his opera <i>Lohengrin</i> for the first time. He travelled about a lot, conducting in many cities, and waiting for the right time and place to have <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> performed. There were lots of new ideas in this opera, especially in the harmony. There is a famous chord at the beginning which is now called the <i>Tristan chord</i>. Wagner’s new harmonies were gradually to change the way composers all over Europe thought about music.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he wrote another opera: <i><a href="../../../../articles/d/i/e/Die_Meistersinger_von_N%C3%BCrnberg_bcb5.html" title="Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg">Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg</a></i> (<i>The Mastersingers of Nűrnberg</i>). It is different to his other operas because it is a <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Comedy.html" title="Comedy">comedy</a>. It is set in <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">medieval</a> Germany and is about a song <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/n/Contest.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Contest">contest</a>.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a> Wagner had spent so much money that he was in <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/b/Debt.html" title="Debt">debt</a> once more and he fled to <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/u/Stuttgart.html" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> to avoid being put into <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prison</a> (Germany at that time was still made up of lots of small countries, each with their own laws). Then he had a big stroke of luck. The new king of <a href="../../../../articles/b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, Ludwig II, who was only 18 years old, adored the music of Wagner. He had read the poem about the Ring of the Nibelungs (Wagner had written the words, but had not finished the music). King Ludwig invited Wagner to finish the Ring cycle for performances in <a href="../../../../articles/m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a>. He gave him somewhere to live, and his new operas were performed in Munich: <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>, <i>Die Meistersinger von Nűrnberg</i> in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>, <i>Das Rheingold</i> in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/6/1869.html" title="1869">1869</a> and <i>Die Walkűre</i> in <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>. There were plans for a new opera house in Munich, but it was never built because a lot of people were angry with Wagner for being in debt in spite of having lots of money from the king. Another thing people did not like was that he fell in love with the wife of the man who had conducted his operas, Hans von Bűlow. Her name was Cosima. Her father was the composer <a href="../../../../articles/f/r/a/Franz_Liszt_3c14.html" title="Franz Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> who had not been married to Cosima’s mother. Wagner had already left Munich in 1865, but the king still supported him, making it possible for him to live in a large house called Triebschen on Lake Lucerne. Cosima <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorced</a> von Bülow in 1870 and married Wagner in the same year.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Richard_Wagner_c988.html" title="Change section: Bayreuth and Wahnfried">change</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bayreuth and Wahnfried</span></h3>
<p>By now Wagner was working hard at the Ring cycle again. He had promised the king that the four operas would be performed in Munich when they were ready, but he realized that they would need a special kind of opera house. So he designed his own opera house and had it built in the town of Bayreuth. He spent a lot of time travelling and conducting in order to raise money for this huge project. The King Ludwig also gave him a lot of money, and a lovely new house in Bayreuth which Wagner called <i>Wahnfried</i> (the name of the house means something like: <i>Peace from the mad world</i>). Finally, the complete cycle of four operas was performed in August <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a> in the new opera house, the (Bayreuth Festspielhaus). The third and fourth operas of the cycle, <i><a href="../../../../articles/s/i/e/Siegfried_%28opera%29.html" title="Siegfried (opera)">Siegfried</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../../articles/g/%C3%B6/t/G%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung.html" title="Götterdämmerung">Götterdämmerung</a></i> were being performed for the first time.</p>
<p>Wagner spent the rest of his life living in <i>Wahnfried</i>. Sometimes he travelled. He went to <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and made several trips to <a href="../../../../articles/i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. He wrote his last opera, <i><a href="../../../../articles/p/a/r/Parsifal.html" title="Parsifal">Parsifal</a></i>, which almost has a religious feeling to it. The story is related to the legends about <a href="../../../../articles/k/i/n/King_Arthur_40ce.html" title="King Arthur">King Arthur</a> and the Holy Grail. Wagner dictated his memoirs to his wife. His <a href="../../../../articles/a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a> is called <i>Mein Leben</i> (<i>My Life</i>). He died of <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/a/Heart_failure.html" title="Heart failure">heart failure</a> when he was staying in <a href="../../../../articles/v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a>. He was buried in the grounds of <i>Wahnfried</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/r/i/c/Richard_Wagner_c988.html" title="Change section: Wagner’s reputation">change</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wagner’s reputation</span></h2>
<p>Wagner had enormous influence on the development of music. Many composers imitated his harmonies, or let themselves be influenced by them. By the early <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> some composers like <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/n/Arnold_Schoenberg_ee5c.html" title="Arnold Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a> had gone even further in making more and more complicated harmonies, and composers had to find new ways of composing.</p>
<p>Wagner made his orchestras much bigger than usual. The woodwind, for example, need four of each instrument (four <a href="../../../../articles/f/l/u/Flute.html" title="Flute">flutes</a>, four <a href="../../../../articles/o/b/o/Oboe.html" title="Oboe">oboes</a> etc), and there are extra instruments like the <a href="../../../../articles/b/a/s/Bass_clarinet.html" title="Bass clarinet">bass clarinet</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/t/u/b/Tuba.html" title="Tuba">Wagner tubas</a>. His ideas about music drama were very important. His music helps the drama to be told because it develops all the time, like the music in a symphony.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../../articles/h/i/t/Hitler.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> came to power in the <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> he liked Wagner’s music and thought that it was something typically German. Wagner’s ideas in <i>Die Meistersinger von Nűrnberg</i> about German art suited Hitler’s thoughts. After the war, the music was thought of as being something of the <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/z/Nazi.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Nazi">Nazis</a>. Wagner wrote some things that were anti-Jewish. Wagner's music is therefore played very rarely in <a href="../../../../articles/i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>. Daniel Baremboim recently made people in Israel angry by conducting Wagner’s music at a <a href="../../../../articles/j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> festival.</p>
